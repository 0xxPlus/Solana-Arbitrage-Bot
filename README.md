# Solana Arbitrage Bot ‚Äì Real Profitable, Not Just Theory

Most repos show you *endless theory, sample code, or simulations*.
This one is different.

I don‚Äôt like theory. I like practice.
That‚Äôs why instead of publishing source code, I‚Äôve attached:

* üé• **Working demo video** of the bot in action.
* üì∏ **Transaction screenshots & explorer links** proving live profitable trades.
* üîí **Private repo screenshot** (showing the real project exists, but stays private).

No gimmicks, no empty repositories ‚Äî just proof that this bot is **real and profitable**.
