# Solana Arbitrage Bot ‚Äì Real Profitable, Not Just Theory

Most repos show you *endless theory, sample code, or simulations*.
This one is different.

I don‚Äôt like theory. I like practice.
That‚Äôs why instead of publishing source code, I‚Äôve attached:

* üé• **Working demo video** of the bot in action.
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80444f2b-6b18-4ff4-aac6-8c99db9c2ece
* üì∏ **Transaction screenshots & explorer links** proving live profitable trades.
